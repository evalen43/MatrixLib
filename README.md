# MatrixLib

!!! **NEW**2019.1.12 add QR decomposition, Cholesckey decomposition Gram-Schmit orthog, matrix stack, matrix repeat

!!! **NEW**2019.1.11 add LU, LDU, matmul for many matrices, col(from,cnt), row(from,cnt)

Lightweight header-only matrix library (C++) for numerical optimization and machine learning.   
Ease of using is the emphasis of this library. Supported features are as following:
* lightweight
* dependency-free
* templated type
* copy-free matrix-view
* flexiable matrix element access/selection
* variety of operators, including matrix-matrix operators and matrix-number operators
* broadcasting
* type casting
* linear algebra functions

Detailed examples are listed in [main.cpp](https://github.com/liuxiaodong008008/Matrix/blob/master/main.cpp).
